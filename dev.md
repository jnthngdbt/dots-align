# App store description

Find the symmetry in a pattern of dots orbiting a ball. Rotate the dots in 3D to perfectly align them. Do it in the most efficient way possible to boost your points.

A casual puzzle game with a minimalist design.

Game modes:
- Play 10 levels: take your time. Do the smartest moves, when you want.
- Play 30 seconds: beat the clock. Do as much levels as possible in a fixed amount of time to explode your score.

# Premium ideas

- no ads
- unlock all games
- themes
- stats
- other game type
- share analytics insights: correlation between dots, rotation

# Ideas for difficulty

- no depth fog, nor orb, all dots same colors
- 2 patterns no symmetry, 3d rotations
- 2 balls

# Tutorial text draft

(note) could reuse those statements in app store images

GET STARTED

- Find the symmetry in the pattern of dots
- Rotate the dots to make the two symmetric parts overlap
- Small red dots are added as guides to help you get started

HOW IT WORKS (in game), or HOW TO PLAY

- Find the symmetry in the pattern of dots
- Rotate the dots to make the two symmetric parts overlap
- The level score is the number of dots multiplied by the boost level
- The boost level decreases when you rotate the dots
- The boost level determines the number of dots of the next level
